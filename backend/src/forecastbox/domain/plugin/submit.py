"""API for submitting venv-mutating operations in a safe manner to the bounded
``ConcurrentPools.PluginManagement``.

Assumed to be invoked from the plugins router in API, and during application startup.

``ConcurrentPools.PluginManagement`` is registered with exactly one worker. This is a
correctness boundary, not merely an I/O pool: pip installation, module reload/import,
and plugin catalogue publication all mutate process-global state, so at most one such
operation may run at a time. ``domain.plugin.state.reserve_operation`` enforces this at
the domain level (rejecting a second concurrent operation) in addition to the pool's own
single worker, since a rejected/queued submission is not enough on its own to prevent two
operations from being simultaneously "in flight" from the domain's point of view.

Every managed operation is wrapped by ``_run_managed`` so that an unexpected exception
is recorded both in the domain-facing error/notification surface (``updater_error`` and
``PluginGlobalErrorEvent``) and in the execution manager's own bounded monitored-failure
history (by re-raising after recording). Per-plugin install/load outcomes represented as
``PluginErrors`` are not managed-operation failures; they are normal completions handled
entirely inside ``domain.plugin.loading``.
