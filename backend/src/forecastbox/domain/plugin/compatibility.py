"""Plugin compatibility helpers.

Centralises the version-compatibility rules between plugins and ``fiab-core``:

* A plugin version ``a.b.c`` is compatible with a ``fiab-core`` version ``x.y.z``
  if and only if ``a == x`` (same major version).

It also owns the runtime plugin installation policy: ``install_plugin_compatibly``
protects the *entire* installed environment while ``uv`` resolves a requested plugin.
This is an immediate risk-reduction measure on top of the current
shared-virtual-environment architecture (the backend still mutates its own
active venv and reloads Python modules in-process); see
``docs/developer/changeSpecs/plugins-candidate_venvs.md`` for a possible
architectural successor that replaces in-place mutation with validated candidate
environments and a handover.

``install_plugin_compatibly`` assumes the environment already satisfies ``uv pip check`` --
it performs no baseline check of its own. Callers that want to guard against attributing
pre-existing, unrelated environment breakage to the plugin being installed/updated must call
``check_environment_baseline()`` themselves first; see ``domain.plugin.loading`` for how the
plugin loader uses it (once per initial batch load, and once per single-plugin update, before
any install is attempted).

Algorithm for ``install_plugin_compatibly``
--------------------------------------------
1. Build the requested plugin requirement from ``pip_source``/``version``/the installed
   ``fiab-core`` major (``plugin_default_specifier``).
2. Freeze the environment of the *running backend interpreter* (``sys.executable``, not whatever
   venv a shell happens to be in) with ``uv pip freeze`` and classify every entry into ordinary
   ``name==version`` pins and editable/local/URL sources.
3. Identify which frozen distribution (if any) is the plugin being installed/updated, by
   canonical distribution name, and exclude it from the snapshot so it is allowed to change.
4. Write the remaining ordinary pins to a temporary constraints file, and keep the remaining
   editable/local entries as explicit requirement arguments.
5. Run ``uv pip install --dry-run`` with the constraints file, the preserved editable/local
   requirements, and the requested plugin requirement.
6. Only if the dry run succeeds, run the identical command for real (differing only by the
   absence of ``--dry-run``).
7. If the real install's target interpreter is the one actually running this code (see
   ``forecastbox.utility.pth_activation``), activate any ``.pth`` files newly created by the
   install (as happens for editable/``-e`` installs), so the plugin becomes importable in this
   process without a restart.
8. Run ``uv pip check`` again as a post-install check.
9. Return the parsed installed-version mapping (from the real install's output only) for the
   plugin manager to persist and reload.

Known limitations (read before touching this module)
------------------------------------------------------
1. This policy is deliberately *stricter* than theoretical dependency compatibility: it freezes
   and preserves every other currently-installed distribution. A different install order, or
   resolving several plugins together in a fresh environment, could produce a valid combined
   state that an incremental, one-plugin-at-a-time install like this one rejects.
2. Plugin uninstall (see ``domain.plugin.loading.uninstall_plugin_sync``) only removes the configured/
   loaded plugin entry; it does not uninstall the plugin's distribution or its dependencies.
   Packages a plugin introduced become part of later environment snapshots and are consequently
   protected by this same mechanism. We cannot reliably infer which packages are now unused,
   because dependencies may be shared with the backend or with other plugins.
3. In-process reload (performed by the plugin manager after a successful install) is incomplete.
   Reloading the plugin's top-level module does not reload already-imported plugin submodules or
   dependencies, does not replace previously-imported symbols, does not update existing class
   instances, and does not safely reinitialize extension modules or global registries. A restart
   remains the only reliable way for one interpreter to observe a coherent set of installed
   modules.
4. The dry run plus complete constraints prevent the resolver from *choosing* to replace a
   protected distribution's version, but they do not provide a filesystem transaction or
   rollback. Installation interruption, colliding files, ``.pth`` behavior, installer bugs, and
   malicious packages remain possible even when the resolver's plan looks correct.
5. A newly added distribution can expose a top-level importable module that collides with an
   existing distribution's module, even though no existing distribution's *version* changed.
6. Plugins are arbitrary trusted Python code once built or imported. This compatibility check is
   a dependency-resolution safeguard, not a security sandbox.
7. The dry run and the real run are two separate resolver executions. Using identical constraints
   and requirements bounds the allowed changes, but a mutable index or a direct/VCS source could
   still resolve differently between the two invocations.
8. Repeated single-plugin installs are order-dependent and can leave unnecessary transitive
   packages installed over time (see point 2). This is an accepted limitation of this immediate
   hardening, to be addressed by the candidate-environment design referenced above.
9. Editable-install activation (see ``forecastbox.utility.pth_activation``) only extends ``sys.path``/
   ``sys.meta_path`` for ``.pth`` files newly created by this install; it never removes entries for a
   plugin that is later moved or uninstalled. Combined with point 3, a full process restart remains
   the only way to guarantee a fully coherent set of importable modules.

Public API
----------
plugin_default_specifier()
    Build the default ``SpecifierSet`` for a plugin install based on the installed fiab-core major.
check_environment_baseline()
    Raise ``PluginEnvironmentAlreadyBroken`` if the running interpreter's environment already
    fails ``uv pip check``, before any plugin install/update is attempted. Known-benign false
    positives (see ``_pip_check_has_only_known_benign_incompatibilities``) are ignored.
install_plugin_compatibly(pip_source, version, module_name)
    Install or update a plugin, freezing and preserving the rest of the environment. Assumes the
    environment is already known-good; does not run the baseline check itself.
get_compatible_versions(plugin_settings, available_versions)
    Filter an iterable of version strings to only compatible ones.
